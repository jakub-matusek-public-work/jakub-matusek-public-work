# About me

I am a fresh graduate from Imperial College London in MSc Computing (Security and Reliability). 
This profile is for my public work and will not feature any of my private projects.

- 👀 I’m interested in cyber security and science connected to space (physics, mathematics, computer science)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that will spark my interest (currently I am exploring the open source landscape so feel free to contact me if you need help with any sort of scientific endevour)
